Project Scenario
You’ve joined a fast-growing AI startup building the next frontier in customer support automation.

Your team is responsible for building UDA-Hub, a Universal Decision Agent designed to plug into existing customer support systems (Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk, internal CRMs) and intelligently resolve tickets. But this isn’t just another FAQ bot.

The goal? Build an agentic system that reads, reasons, routes, and resolves, acting as the operational brain behind support teams.

You’ll need to design an agent system that can:

Understand customer tickets across channels
Decide which agent or tool should handle each case
Retrieve or infer answers when possible
Escalate or summarize issues when necessary
Learn from interactions by updating long-term memory
Your agent should not only automate, it should decide how to automate!

Project Introduction
In this project, you will develop UDA-Hub, an intelligent, multi-agent decision suite capable of resolving customer support tickets across multiple platforms.

Key Capabilities:

Multi-Agent Architecture with LangGraph Design and orchestrate specialized agents (e.g., Supervisor, Classifier, Resolver, Escalation…).

Input Handling Accept incoming support tickets in natural language with metadata (e.g., platform, urgency, history).

Decision Routing and Resolution

Route tickets to the right agent based on classification
Retrieve relevant knowledge via RAG if needed
Resolve or escalate based on confidence and context
Memory Integration

Maintain state during steps of the execution
Short-term memory is used as context to keep conversation running during the same session
Store and recall long-term memory for preferences, as an example
Project Summary
Inputs:

Incoming support ticket (text + metadata)
Internal knowledge base (FAQ, previous tickets)
Optional internal tool (e.g., refund)
Memory store (for prior conversations and resolutions)
Deliverables:

A LangGraph-powered multi-agent system that:

Understands tickets
Routes to correct agent with tools
Resolves or escalates based on decision logic
Uses memory appropriately
