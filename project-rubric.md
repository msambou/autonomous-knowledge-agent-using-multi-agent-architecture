Rubric
Use this project rubric to understand and assess the project criteria.

Data Setup and Knowledge Base Preparation
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Set up the database and knowledge base infrastructure

Successfully set up the database infrastructure and populate the knowledge base with comprehensive support articles.

Successfully run the database management notebook to initialize the databases
Database contains the required tables (Account, User, Ticket, TicketMetadata, TicketMessage, Knowledge)
Knowledge base includes at least 10 additional support articles beyond the provided 4
New articles cover different categories (technical issues, billing, account management, etc.)
All database operations complete without errors
Can demonstrate successful data retrieval from the database
Multi-Agent Architecture with LangGraph
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Design and document multi-agent architecture

Design and document a comprehensive multi-agent architecture before implementation.

Submit a detailed architecture design document in Markdown format

Include a visual diagram showing the multi-agent architecture (can use ASCII art, Mermaid, or similar)

Document the role and responsibilities of each agent in the system

Explain the flow of information and decision-making between agents

Describe how the system handles different types of inputs and expected outputs

Architecture should be based on one of the standard patterns (Supervisor, Hierarchical, Network, etc.)

Implement the designed multi-agent architecture using LangGraph

Implement the designed multi-agent architecture using LangGraph with specialized agents for different tasks.

Implementation matches the documented architecture design

Project includes at least 4 specialized agents

Each agent has a clearly defined role and responsibility as documented

Agents are properly connected using LangGraph's graph structure

Code demonstrates proper agent state management and message passing

Implement task routing and role assignment across agents

Implement intelligent task routing and role assignment across agents based on ticket characteristics.

System can classify incoming tickets and route them to appropriate agents

Routing logic considers ticket content and metadata (e.g. date, urgency, complexity...)

At least one routing decision is made based on ticket classification

Code includes routing logic that can be demonstrated with sample tickets

Routing follows the architecture design principles

Knowledge Retrieval and Tool Usage
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Implement knowledge-based response system with escalation logic

Implement a knowledge retrieval system that provides responses based on articles and escalates when no relevant knowledge is found.

System retrieves relevant knowledge base articles based on ticket content
All responses are based on the content of knowledge base articles
System can demonstrate retrieval of appropriate articles for different ticket types
Implements escalation logic when no relevant knowledge base article is found
System includes confidence scoring to determine when to escalate
Can demonstrate both successful knowledge retrieval and escalation scenarios
Implement support operation tools with database abstraction

Create and implement at least 2 tools that perform support operations with proper database abstraction.

Implement at least 2 functional tools for support operations (e.g., account lookup, subscription management, refund processing)

Tools abstract the interaction with the CultPass database

Tools can be invoked by agents and return structured responses

Tools include proper error handling and validation

Can demonstrate tool usage with sample operations

Tools are properly integrated into the agent workflow

Memory and State Management
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Persist customer interaction history to enable personalized, context-aware support

Implement persistent memory to store and retrieve customer interaction history.

System stores conversation history in a persistent database

Can retrieve previous interactions for returning customers

Uses historical context to provide personalized responses

Demonstrates memory retrieval with sample customer interactions

Implement state, session and long-term memory in agent workflows

Implement different types of memory in agent workflows.

Agents maintain state during multi-step interactions in one execution.
Based on the appropriate scope (like thread_id or session_id), it's possible to inspect the workflow (e.g. messages, tool_usage)
Short-term memory is used as context to keep conversation running during the same session
Long-term memory is used to store resolved issues and customer preferences accross different sessions
Memory is properly integrated into agent decision-making
Integration and Testing
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Demonstrate end-to-end ticket processing workflow with proper logging

Demonstrate a complete end-to-end workflow for processing customer support tickets.

System can process a ticket from initial submission to resolution/escalation
Workflow includes classification, routing, knowledge retrieval, tool usage, resolution attempt, and final action
Demonstrates the complete flow with sample tickets
Includes proper error handling and edge cases
System logs agent decisions, routing choices, tool usage and outcomes
All logs are structured and searchable
Shows both successful resolution and escalation scenarios
Demonstrates tool integration in the workflow
Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out
Advanced Knowledge Retrieval: Implement sophisticated semantic search using embeddings or vector databases for better article matching
Multi-Channel Support: Extend the system to handle tickets from different channels (email, chat, social media)
Sentiment Analysis: Add sentiment analysis to prioritize urgent or frustrated customer tickets
A/B Testing Framework: Implement a framework to test different routing strategies and measure their effectiveness
MCP: Create specialized tools for common support operations (refunds, account modifications, etc.) using FastMCP
